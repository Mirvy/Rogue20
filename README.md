# Rogue20
The goal of this project is to improve my dexterity with various boost libraries.
The project itself is an attempt to implement the D&D 3.5e rule set in a library
which can be used to produce a functional roleplaying game. The Boost library will
be utilised to experiment and libtcod will serve as the api for input/output.
